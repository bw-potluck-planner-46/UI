Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?

Our App solves the crisis of having to get in contact with whoever you want to invite, with this app you can plan and invite people to a potluck and it will send to anyone that is included in the App. 

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

you don’t have to search through all your contacts and find their numbers or social messaging platforms but you can just have them all added in the app and create the event. 

- What is the mission statement?

Have you ever struggled with planning an event such as a Potluck. Do you struggle having to find everyone to invite them to your potluck. Well no more with Potluck Planner we have provided to you a way to plan a Potluck so then you can share it with everyone you want to invite, this makes it easier to plan, you can add an event and send that event to everyone within minimal clicks compared to actually having to write an invite out and then finding contacts and then finally asking and sending them forsaid invite.
